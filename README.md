# Walking-Robot-Design
This is a walking robot designed in Fusion360 using the Jansen linkage mechanism, done as part of Engineering Design core course. The complete report can be found on this repo along with a ppt.

*	This robot was designed prioritising cost effectiveness but also an efficiency.
*	In this project, we calculated the dimensions required for least cost and visualized the stresses that developed using Ansys.
